			<h3>Passion for Programming</h3>
			<p>I attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale my first year and transferred over to 
			their sister school - SIUE. I found my love for programming during my junior year of high school.
			 It was a class that was quite different from any other offered, even though we did have Mandarin 
			 as an option as well (I took Spanish instead). I was always had a love for solving problems but when 
			 I learned that I could solve problems using a simple text editor on a computer, that love expanded beyond 
			 its original capacity. From the day I completed my first program up until now, my passion for solving 
			 problems continue to grow. There is no better satisfaction or adrenaline rush than completing a program, 
			 knowing that you put a lot of effort and time into it.</p>
